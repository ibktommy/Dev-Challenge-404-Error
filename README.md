  Taking the challenge has been helpful in enabling me to remember some of the things I learnt while I was taking an Udemy course on creating a modern website using techniques like the flexbox system.

- What have you learned/improved?
  I have learn more about using GIT Bash to create a repository and also uploading my websites on NETLIFY.
